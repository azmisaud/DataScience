# My Data Science Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks where I am learning and exploring key libraries and concepts used in Data Science, including NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and more. The notebooks serve as my personal notes and experiments as I progress through different topics.

## Contents

### 1. [NumPy.ipynb](./Numpy.ipynb)

### 2. [LearningDataScience.ipynb](./LearningDataScience.ipynb)

## How I'm Working

- I am using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for running my code and experiments.
- These notebooks are primarily for my own practice and understanding, so they may contain notes, explanations, and trial-and-error approaches as I go.

## Next Steps

As I progress in my learning journey, I plan to:

- Dive deeper into machine learning with Scikit-learn.
- Explore deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Experiment with more complex datasets and projects.
